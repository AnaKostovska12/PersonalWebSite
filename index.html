            <h3>Middle School</h3>
            <p>
                My academic journey began at <strong>Vojdan Chernodrinski Primary School</strong>, where I developed a solid educational foundation and lasting relationships. I’m still in touch with many of my teachers, and the friendships I formed during those years have grown into lifelong connections. During this time, I also pursued my passion for volleyball, which taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance — qualities that continue to guide me today.

            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>
                For my secondary education, I attended <strong>Georgi Dimitrov Gymnasium</strong>, enrolling in the natural sciences major (Group B), focusing on physics, chemistry, and biology. This path deepened my interest in the scientific world and sharpened my analytical thinking. I actively participated in Erasmus+ projects that broadened my worldview and enhanced my appreciation for international collaboration.

            <p>
                I graduated high school with excellent results and enrolled at the <strong>Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI)</strong>, where I am currently a first-year student in the Application of Information Technology. Although initially uncertain about technical subjects like programming and advanced mathematics, I quickly discovered my potential and continue to grow my skills and confidence.
