        <p class="intro-text"> My name is Ana Kostovska. I was born on January 12 2005, in Skopje, Macedonia. I am currently a
            first-year student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI). I am passionate about technology and
            always eager to learn more, grow my skills, and explore new opportunities in the field of computer science and I am
            really excited for you to learn more about me</p>

            My academic journey began at Vojdan Chernodrinski Primary School, where I developed not only a solid educational
            foundation but also lasting relationships. I’m still in touch with many of my teachers, and the friendships I
            formed during those years have grown into lifelong connections. During this time, I also pursued my passion for
            volleyball, which taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance — qualities that continue to guide me today.

            For my secondary education, I attended Georgi Dimitrov Gymnasium, enrolling in the natural sciences major (Group B),
            where I focused on subjects such as physics, chemistry, and biology. This path deepened my interest in the scientific
            world and sharpened my analytical thinking. In addition to academics, I was an active participant in several Erasmus+
            projects, organized both by the school and external institutions. These experiences allowed me to travel, explore diverse
            cultures, exchange ideas with peers across Europe, and step far outside my comfort zone. They not only broadened my worldview
            but also gave me unforgettable memories and a deeper appreciation for international collaboration.

            I graduated high school with excellent academic results and made a clear decision to follow my passion for mathematics
            and technology. This led me to enroll at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI), where I am currently a
            first-year student in the Application of Information Technology.

            Although I initially felt uncertain about understanding technical subjects like programming and advanced mathematics —
            due to a limited foundation in these areas — I quickly discovered that I was capable of far more than I expected. With
            each passing semester, I continue to grow, achieving stronger results and becoming more confident in my skills.

            Studying at FINKI has offered more than just academic knowledge. It has immersed me in a vibrant student community where
            collaboration, mutual support, and shared goals are part of everyday life. I’ve learned the importance of helping others,
            and I actively assist my classmates with subjects I excel in. For me, learning is not just a personal journey but a shared
            experience — one where we lift each other up and grow together.
